# BUMP

Music discovery app that makes finding the new music on Spotify as easily as possible. Spotify is great but seems to lack in the department of showing users the hottest undiscovered tracks. BUMP makes this simple by using a tinder-like card swiping view of songs based on the user's custom set filters. Only the 30 sec preview and cover art of the current song plays while the user decides to swipe left, right or up. If swiped right or upwards the song gets added to the "BUMP Likes" or the "BUMP Super Likes" playlist created on their Spotify account when they signed up for BUMP.
